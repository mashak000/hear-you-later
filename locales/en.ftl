         The <b>collective_ism</b> team created this bot to preserve and send forward anything you find meaningful to share. We want to collect sounds, words, music — anything that can be put into an audio format — archive it, and publish it in a year. If you’d like to contribute, please read the rules and press «Leave a message». Deadline 31 December 2025.

         <b>Participation Rules:</b>

         1. The audio must be your own work.
         2. You may send a voice message or upload a pre-recorded audio file.
         3. Content containing violence, threats, or hate speech is not allowed.
         4. The maximum file size is 15 MB.
         5. The maximum duration is 5 minutes.
         6. Any submitted file automatically becomes part of a public archive. By sending audio, you agree that it will be published publicly. Please note: publication is planned for one year from now!
